.SH EXAMPLES
The most common use checks the given domain recursively, plus any
URL pointing outside of the domain:
  \fBlinkchecker http://www.example.net/\fP
.br
Beware that this checks the whole site which can have thousands of URLs.
Use the \fB\-r\fP option to restrict the recursion depth.
.br
Don't check \fBmailto:\fP URLs. All other links are checked as usual:
  \fBlinkchecker \-\-ignore\-url=^mailto: mysite.example.org\fP
.br
Checking a local HTML file on Unix:
  \fBlinkchecker ../bla.html\fP
.br
Checking a local HTML file on Windows:
  \fBlinkchecker c:\\temp\\test.html\fP
.br
You can skip the \fBhttp://\fP url part if the domain starts with \fBwww.\fP:
  \fBlinkchecker www.example.com\fP
.br
You can skip the \fBftp://\fP url part if the domain starts with \fBftp.\fP:
  \fBlinkchecker \-r0 ftp.example.org\fP
.br
Generate a sitemap graph and convert it with the graphviz dot utility:
  \fBlinkchecker \-odot \-v www.example.com | dot \-Tps > sitemap.ps\fP
.

Fallback straight to GET requests if a HEAD request returns text/plain
as the content type. This is useful with misconfigured web servers
that respond to a HEAD request with the wrong Content-Type header.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
Configuration files can specify all options above. They can also
specify some options that cannot be set on the command line.
See \fBlinkcheckerrc\fP(5) for more info.

.SH OUTPUT TYPES

You should use the \fB\-\-verbose\fP option to get the complete URL list,
especially when outputting a sitemap graph format.

.TP
\fBtext\fP
Standard text logger, logging URLs in keyword: argument fashion.
.TP
\fBhtml\fP
Log URLs in keyword: argument fashion, formatted as HTML.
Additionally has links to the referenced pages. Invalid URLs have
HTML and CSS syntax check links appended.
.TP

.TP
\fBsql\fP
Log check result as SQL script with INSERT commands. An example
script to create the initial SQL table is included as create.sql.
.TP
\fBblacklist\fP
Suitable for cron jobs. Logs the check result into a file
\fB~/.linkchecker/blacklist\fP which only contains entries with invalid
URLs and the number of times they have failed.
.TP
\fBnone\fP
Logs nothing. Suitable for debugging or checking the exit code.
.
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
LinkChecker accepts Python regular expressions.
See \fBhttp://docs.python.org/\:howto/regex.html\fP for an introduction.

An addition is that a leading exclamation mark negates the regular
expression.
.
.SH COOKIE FILES
A cookie file contains standard HTTP header (RFC 2616) data with the
following possible names:
.
.TP
\fBScheme\fP (optional)
Sets the scheme the cookies are valid for; default scheme is \fBhttp\fP.
.TP
\fBHost\fP (required)
Sets the domain the cookies are valid for.
.TP
\fBPath\fP (optional)
Gives the path the cookies are value for; default path is \fB/\fP.
.TP
\fBSet-cookie\fP (optional)
Set cookie name/value. Can be given more than once.
.PP
Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.
.
The example below will send two cookies to all URLs starting with
\fBhttp://example.com/hello/\fP and one to all URLs starting
with \fBhttps://example.org/\fP:

 Host: example.com
 Path: /hello
 Set-cookie: ID="smee"
 Set-cookie: spam="egg"

 Scheme: https
 Host: example.org
 Set-cookie: baggage="elitist"; comment="hologram"

.SH PROXY SUPPORT
To use a proxy on Unix or Windows set the $http_proxy, $https_proxy or $ftp_proxy
environment variables to the proxy URL. The URL should be of the form
\fBhttp://\fP[\fIuser\fP\fB:\fP\fIpass\fP\fB@\fP]\fIhost\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP].
LinkChecker also detects manual proxy settings of Internet Explorer under
Windows systems. On a Mac use the Internet Config to select a proxy.
.
You can also set a comma-separated domain list in the $no_proxy environment
variables to ignore any proxy settings for these domains.
.
Setting a HTTP proxy on Unix for example looks like this:

  export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"

Proxy authentication is also supported:

  export http_proxy="http://user1:mypass@proxy.example.org:8081"

Setting a proxy on the Windows command prompt:

  set http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080

.SH PERFORMED CHECKS
All URLs have to pass a preliminary syntax test. Minor quoting
mistakes will issue a warning, all other invalid syntax issues
are errors.
After the syntax check passes, the URL is queued for connection
checking. All connection check types are described below.
.
.TP
HTTP links (\fBhttp:\fP, \fBhttps:\fP)
After connecting to the given HTTP server the given path
or query is requested. All redirections are followed, and
if user/password is given it will be used as authorization
when necessary.
Permanently moved pages issue a warning.
All final HTTP status codes other than 2xx are errors.
.
HTML page contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Local files (\fBfile:\fP)
A regular, readable file that can be opened is valid. A readable
directory is also valid. All other files, for example device files,
unreadable or non-existing files are errors.
.
HTML or other parseable file contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Mail links (\fBmailto:\fP)
A mailto: link eventually resolves to a list of email addresses.
If one address fails, the whole list will fail.
For each mail address we check the following things:
.
  1) Check the adress syntax, both of the part before and after
     the @ sign.
  2) Look up the MX DNS records. If we found no MX record,
     print an error.
  3) Check if one of the mail hosts accept an SMTP connection.
     Check hosts with higher priority first.
     If no host accepts SMTP, we print a warning.
  4) Try to verify the address with the VRFY command. If we got
     an answer, print the verified address as an info.
.TP
FTP links (\fBftp:\fP)
  
  For FTP links we do:
  
  1) connect to the specified host
  2) try to login with the given user and password. The default
     user is ``anonymous``, the default password is ``anonymous@``.
  3) try to change to the given directory
  4) list the file with the NLST command

.TP
Telnet links (``telnet:``)
  
  We try to connect and if user/password are given, login to the
  given telnet server.

.TP
NNTP links (``news:``, ``snews:``, ``nntp``)
  
  We try to connect to the given NNTP server. If a news group or
  article is specified, try to request it from the server.

.TP
Unsupported links (``javascript:``, etc.)
  
  An unsupported link will only print a warning. No further checking
  will be made.
  
  The complete list of recognized, but unsupported links can be found
  in the \fBlinkcheck/checker/unknownurl.py\fP source file.
  The most prominent of them should be JavaScript links.

.SH RECURSION
Before descending recursively into a URL, it has to fulfill several
conditions. They are checked in this order:

1. A URL must be valid.

2. A URL must be parseable. This currently includes HTML files,
   Opera bookmarks files, and directories. If a file type cannot
   be determined (for example it does not have a common HTML file
   extension, and the content does not look like HTML), it is assumed
   to be non-parseable.

3. The URL content must be retrievable. This is usually the case
   except for example mailto: or unknown URL types.

4. The maximum recursion level must not be exceeded. It is configured
   with the \fB\-\-recursion\-level\fP option and is unlimited per default.

5. It must not match the ignored URL list. This is controlled with
   the \fB\-\-ignore\-url\fP option.

6. The Robots Exclusion Protocol must allow links in the URL to be
   followed recursively. This is checked by searching for a
   "nofollow" directive in the HTML header data.

Note that the directory recursion reads all files in that
directory, not just a subset like \fBindex.htm*\fP.

.SH NOTES
URLs on the commandline starting with \fBftp.\fP are treated like
\fBftp://ftp.\fP, URLs starting with \fBwww.\fP are treated like
\fBhttp://www.\fP.
You can also give local files as arguments.

If you have your system configured to automatically establish a
connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when
checking links not pointing to your local host.
Use the \fB\-\-ignore\-url\fP option to prevent this.

Javascript links are not supported.

If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker disables it
automatically.

You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.

When checking \fBnews:\fP links the given NNTP host doesn't need to be the
same as the host of the user browsing your pages.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fBNNTP_SERVER\fP - specifies default NNTP server
.br
\fBhttp_proxy\fP - specifies default HTTP proxy server
.br

.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is 2 when
.IP \(bu
a program error occurred.
.PP
The return value is 1 when
.IP \(bu
invalid links were found or
.IP \(bu
link warnings were found and warnings are enabled
.PP
Else the return value is zero.
.
.SH LIMITATIONS
LinkChecker consumes memory for each queued URL to check. With thousands
of queued URLs the amount of consumed memory can become quite large. This
might slow down the program or even the whole system.
