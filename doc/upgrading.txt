Upgrading
=========
Migrating from 8.x to 9.0
-------------------------
The Python requests module is now required.

Several checks have been moved to plugins (see below).
Plugins have to be enabled in the configuration file.

The following commandline and configuration options have been deprecated
and do not have any effect:
--anchors, anchors: moved to plugin AnchorCheck
--check-css, checkcss: moved to plugin CssSyntaxCheck
--check-html, checkhtml: moved to plugin HtmlSyntaxCheck
--complete: feature removed
--cookies, sendcookies, storecookies: cookies are sent/stored per default
--pause, wait: replaced with numrequestspersecond
--scan-virus, scanvirus: moved to plugin VirusCheck
--warning-regex: moved to plugin RegexCheck
--warning-size-bytes, warnsizebytes: feature removed
warnsslcertdaysvalid: moved to plugin SslCertificationCheck

The "html" logger generates HTML5 documents now.

The following warnings have been removed:
- http-auth-unauthorized: removed
- http-auth-unknonwn: removed
- http-decompress-error: removed
- http-robots-denied: downgraded to info
- http-moved-permanent: downgraded to info
- http-unsupported-encoding: removed
- https-certificate-error: is an error now
- mail-unverified-address: removed
- mail-no-connection: removed
- syntax-css: moved to plugin
- syntax-html: moved to plugin
- url-anchor-not-found: moved to plugin
- url-content-size-unequal: removed
- url-warnregex-found: moved to plugin

Migrating from 8.4 to 8.5
--------------------------
Custom output loggers have been changed.
See doc/web/content/faq.md for an example with custom loggers.

Migrating from 8.0 to 8.1
-------------------------
All loggers have an additional output field "modified".
If these loggers are not configured with specific output parts,
the output format will change.
For example existing SQL tables can be altered with:
alter table linkcheck add (modified varchar(256));

The default User-Agent string used by LinkChecker is now
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; LinkChecker/8.1; +http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/)

Migrating from 7.9 to 8.0
-------------------------
Python 2.7.2 or newer is required (Python 3.x is not supported though).

Migrating from 7.6 to 7.7
-------------------------
The deprecated options --check-html-w3 and --check-css-w3
have been removed from the commandline client.

Migrating from 7.3 to 7.4
-------------------------
Python 2.7 or newer is required (Python 3.x is not supported though).

The deprecated options --interactive, --priority and --allow-root
have been removed from the commandline client.

Migrating from 7.0 to 7.1
-------------------------
The FastCGI module lc.fcgi has been removed.
The lc.cgi module can be used instead.

Migrating from 6.x to 7.0
-------------------------
The system configuration file support has been removed.
There is now only one user-configurable configuration file.
On Unix systems it is at $HOME/.linkchecker/linkcheckerrc
and on Windows systems at %HOMEPATH%\.linkchecker\linkcheckerrc

Migrating from 6.6 to 6.7
-------------------------
The machine readable output formats xml, csv and sql now report
the recursion level of each URL.

Migrating from 6.4 to 6.5
-------------------------
Only applies if a custom output loggers has been programmed:
The URL data model for output loggers has changed. The list of
warning messages is now a list of tuples (tagname, warningmessage).

Migrating from 5.5 to 6.0
-------------------------
Python 2.6 or newer is required (Python 3.x is not supported though).

The deprecated --no-proxy-for and --no-anchor-caching options have been
removed.

The configuration file now requires multiline syntax for the options
"nofollow", "ignore" and "entry".

Migrating from 5.2 to 5.3
-------------------------
The --password option now reads a password from stdin instead
taking it from the commandline. This prevents reading the password
from the commandline string with tools like ``ps``.

Migrating from 5.1 to 5.2
-------------------------
The --no-proxy-for option has been deprecated and will be removed
in a future release. Also, the "noproxyfor" entries in configuration
files will not be evaluated anymore.
You should use the $no_proxy environment variable instead, which
specifies a comma-separated list of domains that are not contacted
over proxies.

Migrating from 5.0 to 5.1
-------------------------
The --no-anchor-caching option has been deprecated and will be removed
in a future release. This option should not be used anymore.

The exit code of the linkchecker script will be zero now if all
warnings have been ignored.

Migrating from 4.x to 5.0
-------------------------
Python >= 2.5 is now required.

The CGI script access control has been removed. Please use the access
control of your webserver to restrict access to the CGI script.
An example configuration file for the Apache weberver has been included
in the distribution.

Migrating from 4.4 to 4.5
-------------------------
Configuration file entries that were enumerated (``ignoreX``,
``nofollowX``, ``noproxyX`` and ``entryX``) now have a new multiline
syntax. For example the old configuration:

::

  ignore1=^mailto:
  ignore2=^nntp:

should be written as:

::

  ignore=
    ^mailto:
    # this is a comment
    ^nntp:

Note the leading spac(es) at the beginning of each line after
``ignore=``.
If an indented line starts with a comment sign, it will be ignored.

Migrating from 4.2 to 4.3
-------------------------
The deprecated ``--disable-psyco`` option has been removed.

Migrating from 4.1 to 4.2
-------------------------
If run under Unix system as the 'root' user, LinkChecker drops
privileges and runs under the 'nobody' user account.
The new option --allow-root prevents this, ie. enables the old
pre-4.2 behaviour.

Migrating from 3.x to 4.0
-------------------------
The Python API of the linkcheck module has changed. If you were
using the library directly instead of the commandline or CGI
interfaces, you will have to adjust your code.

The default intern pattern matches now both http and https. When
checking a site ``http://example.com/``, all URLs of the form
``https://example.com/`` will now also be checked recursively.

LinkChecker now honors a "Crawl-delay" entry in robots.txt files.
The delay makes LinkChecker pause between requests to the corresponding
server, so your checking time might increase if the server enforces
such a delay through its robots.txt file.

URLs with invalid syntax are now cached, and they get matched now by
the --ingore-url option.

Migrating from 3.0 to 3.1
-------------------------

The ``xml`` output logger has been renamed to ``gxml``.


Migrating from 2.x to 3.0
-------------------------
The --warnings option is deprecated since warnings are now printed
per default. A new --no-warnings has been added if one wants to
have the old behaviour. Additionally, some old warnings about have
been removed.

The previously deprecated --status option has been removed.

The options --intern, --extern and --extern-strict have been replaced
by --ignore-url and --no-follow-url.

The configuration file format has changed. See the distributed
linkcheckerrc default config for the new syntax.


Migrating from 2.2 to 2.3
-------------------------
The per-user config file is now ``~/.linkchecker/linkcheckerrc``
(previous location was ``~/.linkcheckerrc`` ).

The default blacklist output file is now ``~/.linkchecker/blacklist``
(previous location was ``~/.blacklist``).

Python >= 2.4 is now required.


Migrating from 1.x to 2.0
-------------------------
The --output and --file-output parameters can specify the encoding
now. You should check your scripts if they support the new option
syntax.

Some added checks might trigger new warnings, so automated scripts
or alarms can have more output than with 1.x releases.

All output (file and console) is now encoded according to a given
character set encoding which defaults to ISO-8859-15. If you
relied that output was in a specific encoding, you might want to
use the output encoding option.


Migrating from 1.12.x to 1.13.0
-------------------------------
Since lots of filenames have changed you should check that any
manually installed versions prior to 1.13.0 are removed. Otherwise
you will have startup problems.

The default output logger ``text`` has now colored output if the
output terminal supports it. The old ``colored`` output logger has
been removed.

The ``-F`` option no longer suppresses normal output. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``-onone``.

The --status option is now the default and has been deprecated. The
old behaviour can be restored by giving the option ``--no-status``.

The default recursion depth is now infinite. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``--recursion-level=1``.

The option ``--strict`` has been renamed to ``--extern-strict-all``.

The commandline program ``linkchecker`` returns now non-zero exit value
when errors were encountered. Previous versions always return a zero
exit value.
For scripts to ignore exit values and therefore restore the old behaviour
you can append a ``|| true`` at the end of the command.
