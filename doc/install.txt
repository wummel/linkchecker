Installation
============
If you are upgrading from older versions of LinkChecker you should
also read the upgrading documentation stored in upgrading.txt.

Setup with pip
------------------
If pip_ is available, this command should install LinkChecker on
the local system:

.. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

``sudo pip install LinkChecker``

Note that this needs the Python development and a C compiler installed.
For example on Debian Linux systems use ``sudo apt-get install python-dev``.


Setup for Windows
-----------------
Execute ``LinkChecker-x.y.exe`` and follow the instructions.


Setup for Mac OS X
------------------
Nobody is currently offering a "dmg" download for Mac OS X
See https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/issues/625
...however the steps for compiling it from source are given below.


Setup for GNU/Linux
-------------------
On all major Linux distributions (Debian, Mandriva, Redhat, Suse, Ubuntu),
the ``linkchecker`` package is available for install.


Manual setup for Unix systems
-----------------------------
First, install the required software.

1. You need a standard GNU development environment with
   
   - C compiler (for example the GNU C Compiler gcc)
     
     Depending on your distribution, several development packages
     might be needed to provide a fully functional C development
     environment.
   
   Note for developers: if you want to regenerate the po/linkchecker.pot
   template from the source files, you will need xgettext with Python
   support. This is available in gettext >= 0.12.

2. Python >= 2.7.2 from http://www.python.org/
   
   Be sure to also have installed the included distutils module.
   On most distributions, the distutils module is included in
   an extra ``python-dev`` package.

3. Python requests module from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests

4. *Optional, for bash-completion:*
   argcomplete Python module from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argcomplete

5. *Optional, for displaying country codes:*
   GeoIP from http://www.maxmind.com/app/python

6. *Optional, used for Virus checking:*
   ClamAv from http://www.clamav.net/

7. *Optional, for GNOME proxy setting parsing:*
    Python Gtk from http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html

8. *Optional, to run the WSGI web interface:*
   Apache from http://httpd.apache.org/
   mod_wsgi from http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/


Now install the application.

1. Compile Python modules
   
   Run ``python setup.py sdist --manifest-only`` to create the MANIFEST
   file.
   Run ``python setup.py build`` to compile the Python files.
   For help about the setup.py script options, run
   ``python setup.py --help``.
   The CC environment variable is checked before compilation, so you can
   change the default C compiler with ``export CC=myccompiler``.

2.
   a) Installation as root
      
      Run ``sudo python setup.py install`` to install LinkChecker.
   
   b) Installation as a normal user
      
      Run ``python setup.py install --home $HOME``. Note that you have
      to adjust your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables, eg. by
      adding the commands ``export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python`` and
      ``export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin`` to your shell configuration
      file.
      
      For more information look at the `Modifying Python's search path`_
      documentation.
      
      .. _Modifying Python's search path:
         http://docs.python.org/inst/search-path.html#SECTION000410000000000000000


After installation
------------------
LinkChecker is now installed. Have fun!

Manual setup for OSX systems
----------------------------

1. Install the XCode developer tools

2. Install homebrew_
   
   .. _homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

3. Install dependencies

   brew update
   brew install python
   brew install gettext
   # link gettext or put the msgfmt binary in your PATH
   brew link --force gettext

4. Install py2app 
   (from http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html#installation)
   Requires 'easy_install' --
   $ curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
   $ sudo python ez_setup.py -U setuptools
   Now install py2app:
   $ sudo easy_install -U py2app

5. git clone git@github.com:wummel/linkchecker.git linkchecker

6. cd linkchecker

7. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors`` and after that ``make app``

8. Install the resulting .dmg

   # mount DMG
   mkdir -p dist/mnt
   hdiutil attach -mountpoint dist/mnt dist/LinkChecker-x.y.z.dmg
   # to run directly
   open -n dist/mnt/LinkChecker.app --args http://www.example.org
   # install the app
   sudo cp -r dist/mnt/LinkChecker.app /Applications
   # unmount DMG
   hdiutil detach dist/mnt


WSGI web interface
-----------------------
The included WSGI script can run LinkChecker with a nice graphical web
interface.
You can use and adjust the example HTML files in the lconline directory
to run the script.

1. Note that running LinkChecker requires CPU and memory resources.
   Allowing a WSGI script to execute such a program for possibly a
   large number of users might deplete those resources.
   Be sure to only allow access from trusted sites to this script.
   
2. Copy the script lc.wsgi in the WSGI directory.

3. Adjust the "action=..." parameter in lconline/lc_cgi.html
   to point to your WSGI script.

4. If you use Apache, copy config/linkchecker.apache2.conf
   into your Apache configuration directory (eg. /etc/apache2/conf.d)
   and enable it.

5. Load the lconline/index.html file, enter an URL and click on the
   check button.

6. If something goes wrong, check the following:
   
   a) look in the error log of your web server
   b) be sure that you have enabled WSGI support in your web server,
      for example by installing mod_wsgi for Apache
   c) be sure that you have enabled the negotiation and versioning
      modules for Apache:
      a2enmod version
      a2enmod negotiation
